LWFOLDERINDEX plugin for TYPO3

This plugin ensures that folders aren't just indexed FE like air_filemanager does, but also backend. This takes care of folders not
showing up in the FE, but showing up in the next refresh instead.

HOW TO USE

Install this plugin via the TYPO3 extension manager. 
Since this is a scheduler task, go to Scheduler in the left list view and create a new Task
Fill out a run frequency, runtime (default 1 day), file system root (this is the relative path of the folder you wish to index, so /fileadmin for example) and click the save button

Now all folders in the given path will be indexed, the ACLs will be taken into account. When a new folder is found default behavior is to copy the ACLs of its parent folder.
